# Welcome to the ResumeLM Blog ðŸ‘‹

We're excited to launch a **public, unprotected** space where anyone can read about:

1. Tips for writing AI-assisted resumes
2. Product updates & roadmap insights
3. Deep dives into our tech stack (Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase, etc.)

> Our goal is to be transparent and share useful knowledge with the community.
